Trading Algorithm with Quality Metric
This repository contains a Python-based trading algorithm designed to evaluate the financial market using the Quality metric from Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas. The script employs machine learning techniques, particularly a Random Forest Classifier, to predict market trends and execute trades based on the Quality of trading signals.

Features
Market Data Integration: Fetches hourly stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Feature Engineering: Includes derived features such as returns, range, and a custom Quality metric.
Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to make trading decisions.
Backtesting Framework: Simulates trading to evaluate performance with metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Annualized Return, and Win Rate.
Comparison with Buy-and-Hold: Benchmarks model performance against a traditional buy-and-hold strategy.
Visualization: Plots equity curves for the trading model and buy-and-hold strategy.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copiar c贸digo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trading-algorithm-quality.git
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copiar c贸digo
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Fetch and preprocess historical data:

The script downloads hourly stock data for the ETF QQQ using the yfinance library.
Derived features, including the Quality metric, are calculated for each time window.
Train the machine learning model:

A Random Forest Classifier is trained using time-series cross-validation.
Simulate trading:

Trades are executed based on model predictions.
A detailed equity curve is generated for both training and testing datasets.
Analyze performance:

Metrics such as Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown are calculated.
Compare results against a buy-and-hold strategy.
Key Metrics
The algorithm evaluates the following metrics:

Total Return: Overall percentage change in portfolio value.
Annualized Return: Adjusted returns for one year.
Sharpe Ratio: Return-to-risk ratio compared to a risk-free rate.
Max Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline in equity.
Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades.
Quality Metric: Evaluates trade quality based on expectancy and variability.
Visualization
The script generates the following plots:

Equity Curve: Tracks portfolio value over time.
Comparison: Equity curve of the model versus buy-and-hold strategy.
